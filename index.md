# Andrew Happ's First CS193 Homework

- The teachers are super relatable being students themselves, and its nice to have that mutual relationship you don't typically have with professors
- Class seems to be relatively laid back as long as you pay attention and work hard
- A great introductory course to those who may have no coding experience or struggle with manuvering early computer tools
- NO EXAMS!
